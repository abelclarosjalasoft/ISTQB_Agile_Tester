Refer to [[ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf]], test activities are related to development activities, so testing varies in different cycles.

Agile models are different in the way testing and development activities are integrated, the project work products, the names, entry and exit criteria, the use of tools, and how [[independent testing\|independent testing]] can be effectively utilized.

Organizations may deviate from the ideal Agile project implementation, an Agile tester should be able to adapt to the context of the current project to be successful.

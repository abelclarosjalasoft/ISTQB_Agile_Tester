Many practices may be useful for testers in a scrum team, some of which include: 
- ***Pairing:*** Two team members (e.g., a tester and a developer, two testers, or a tester and a product owner) sit together at one workstation to perform a testing or other sprint task. 
- ***Incremental test design:*** Test cases and charters are gradually built from user stories and other test bases, starting with simple tests and moving toward more complex ones. 
- ***Mind mapping:*** Mind mapping is a useful tool when testing. For example, testers can use mind mapping to identify which test sessions to perform, to show test strategies, and to describe test data.

The role of a tester in an Agile team includes activities that generate and provide feedback not only on test status, test progress, and product quality, but also on process quality.

Activities:
- Understanding, implementing, and updating the test strategy
- Measuring and reporting test coverage across all applicable coverage dimensions
- Ensuring proper use of testing tools
- Configuring, using, and managing test environments and test data
- Reporting defects and working with the team to resolve them
- Coaching other team members in relevant aspects of testing
- Ensuring the appropriate testing tasks are scheduled during release and iteration planning 
- Actively collaborating with developers and business stakeholders to clarify requirements, especially in terms of testability, consistency, and completeness

- Participating proactively in team retrospectives, suggesting and implementing improvements

[[ISTQB/Quality is responsibility of the whole team\|Quality is responsibility of the whole team]] and every team member plays a role in performing test-related tasks.

Test-related organizational risks:
- Testers work so closely to developers that they lose the appropriate tester mindset
- Testers become tolerant of or silent about inefficient, ineffective, or low-quality practices within the team
- Testers cannot keep pace with the incoming changes in time-constrained iterations

To avoid/mitigate these risks the organization may refer to [[ISTQB/Organizational Options for Independent Testing\|Organizational Options for Independent Testing]]

Testers can use various methods to record test progress and status:
- Test automation results
- Progression of test tasks and stories on Agile Tasks Boards
- Burndown charts represent the amount of work left to be done against time allocated to the release or iteration. Those charts track progress across the iteration and the entire release.
- Wiki like dashboards that can also gather metrics from the testing progress.

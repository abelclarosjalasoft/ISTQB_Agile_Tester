Planning mentioned in [[ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf]]

Planning is a constant activity through the process
We have two types of planning:
- [[Release Planning]] 
- [[Iteration Planning]]


Any change in the [[Iteration Planning]] or [[Release Planning]] can be challenging for testers. For this, testers should have adequate test cases and test oracle in each iteration [[ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf]] Section 1.4.
 
 Particular test-related issues to address:
 - Scope of testing: extent of the testing, test goals, and reasons for those decisions.
 - Who will carry out the testing activities.
- Test environment and test data needed
- Timing, sequencing, dependencies, and prerequisites for the functional and non-functional test activities.
- project and quality risks to be addressed. [[Assess quality risks within an Agile project]]

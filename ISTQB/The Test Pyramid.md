A system is usually tested at different levels (listed from top to bottom):
- Acceptance testing
- System testing
- Integration testing
- Unit testing
Refer to [[ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf|ISTQB Foundation Level Syllabus]] (Section 2.2)

![[Test Pyramid.excalidraw]]

At the bottom of the pyramid (unit testing) we have large number of tests, and as the development moves up the number of tests decreases (acceptance testing).
The pyramid concept is based on the principle of early testing.

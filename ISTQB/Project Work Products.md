Project work products have three categories:
- ***Business-oriented work products***: what is needed (requirements) and how to use it (user documentation)
- ***Development work products***: How the system is built (data base entity-relationship diagrams), code, automated unit tests.
- ***Test work products***: how the system is tested ( test strategies and plans), that actually test the system (manual and automated tests), or that present test results (test dashboard as discussed in [[2. Fundamental Agile Testing Principles, Practices, and Processes#^f285f8|2.2.1]])

[[Agile Manifesto#^4638ba|Documentation is avoided in Agile projects]], but it only applies to documentation that is not delivered to the customer. The team must balance the effort on documentation and what level of work product is needed.

Typical tester work products on Agile projects include:
- Automated tests
- Test Plans
- Quality risk catalogs
- Manual tests
- Defect reports
- Test results logs
- Metrics from defect reports and test result logs

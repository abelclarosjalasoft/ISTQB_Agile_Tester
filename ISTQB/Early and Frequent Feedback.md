[[Continuous Integration]] enables [[Customer collaboration]]
Agile projects work with short iterations, providing an incomplete product on every delivery, this enables the continuous feedback from the customer. This way the team can incorporate new changes into the product development process.
This also helps the team to focus on feature with the highest business value, o risk.
It also helps the team with the following questions:
- How much work can we do in a sprint or iteration?
- What could help us go faster?
- What is preventing us from doing so?
# Benefits
- Avoid requirements misunderstandings in later stages (most costly to correct)
- Clarify customer feature requests.
- Discover, isolate, and resolving quality problems early
- Provide information to the team regarding its productivity and ability to deliver
- Promote consistent project momentum

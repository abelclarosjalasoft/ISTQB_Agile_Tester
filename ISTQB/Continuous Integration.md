Continuous Integration helps the delivery of a product to be reliable, working, integrated at the end of every iteration/sprint.
# Activities
- ***Static code analysis***: executing static code analysis and reporting results
- ***Compile***: compiling and linking the code, generating executables/builds.
- ***Unit Test***: execute the unit test, check code coverage and reporting results of the testing
- ***Deploy***: installing the build into a test environment
- ***Integration Test***: executing integration tests and reporting results
- ***Result(dashboard)***: posting the status of all these activities to a publicly visible location.
Continuous integration allows Agile testers to run automated tests as part of the continuous integration process. It returns quick feedback to the team on the quality of the code. Automated reports are also possible.
When the regression testing is automated, the testers are free to concentrate on their manual testing tasks.
One of the objectives of CI is to improve quality of the product and also reduce the time taken to deliver it. This is achieved by not waiting to the end of the process to apply quality control.
# Benefits
- Early detection and easy root detection of problems on conflicting changes.
- Regular feedback to the development team on the code quality status.
- Daily tested version of the product
- Reduced risks with regression
- Confidence on the current work
- Makes progress visible to the team
- Eliminate schedule risks with big-bang integration
- Provides executable software during the sprint.
- Reduces repetitive manual testing activities
- Provides quick feedback on decisions made
# Risks and Challenges
- CI tools have to introduced and maintained
- The CI process must be defined and established
- Test automation demands resources and it can be complex
- Test coverage is essential to have the advantages of automated testing
- Sometimes teams over-rely on unit tests and leave system and acceptance testing behind.

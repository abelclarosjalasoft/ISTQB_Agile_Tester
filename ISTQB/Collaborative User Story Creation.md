# 3C Concept
- ***Card***: Physical media that describes a user story. Identifies Requirement, Criticality, Expected Development and Test Duration, and the Acceptance Criteria.
- ***Conversation***: It explains how the software will be used. It can be verbal or documented. It begins during the release planning phase and continues when the story is scheduled.
- ***Confirmation***: The Acceptance Criteria is used to confirm that the story is done. Positive an negative tests should be used to cover the criteria. 

Story documentation should be concise, sufficient, and necessary.

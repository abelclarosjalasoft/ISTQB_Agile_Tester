Agile emphasizes the [[Whole-Team Approach]], where all the team members work together.
Organizational and behavioral best practices in Scrum teams:
- ***Cross-functional:*** Each team member brings a different set of skills to the team
- ***Self-Organizing:*** A team can consist only of developers, but ideally there would be one or more testers. [[Organizational Options for Independent Testing]]
- ***Co-Located:*** The team shares the same physical space.
- ***Collaborative:*** Every team member collaborates with every other team member
- ***Empowered:*** Technical decisions (design and testing) are made by the team as a whole
- ***Committed:*** The tester is committed to evaluate and question the product's behavior from the expectations and needs of the customers and users
- ***Transparent:*** Development and testing progress is visible on the Agile task board. [[Communicating Test Status, Progress, and Product Quality]]
- ***Credible:*** The credibility of the testing strategy, its implementation, and execution are on the hands of the tester. This is done by providing information to the stakeholders about the testing process.
- ***Open to Feedback:*** Feedback is enforced in Agile projects. Retrospectives are important is this regard
- ***Resilient:*** Testing must be able to adapt to changes in the project.

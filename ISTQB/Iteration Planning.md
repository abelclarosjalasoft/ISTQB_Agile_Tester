The team selects user stories from the [[release backlog]], elaborates the user stories, performs risk analysis, and estimates the work needed for each user story. 
Business representatives must answer the team's questions so the team can understand what they should implement and how to test each story.
The number of stories selected is based on established team velocity and the estimated size of the selected user stories.
User stories are then split into tasks that are assigned to the appropriate members.

Testers are involved in [[Iteration Planning]] and add value in the following activities:
- Participate in the risk analysis of user stories
- Determine the testability of the user stories.
- Creating acceptance tests for the user stories
- Breaking down user stories into tasks
- Estimating testing effort for all testing tasks
- Identifying functional and non-functional aspects of the systems to be tested
- Supporting and participating in test automation at multiple levels of testing

Iteration plans may change during an iteration.

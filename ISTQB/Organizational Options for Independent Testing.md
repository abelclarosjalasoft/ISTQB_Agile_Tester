Independent testers are often more effective at finding defects.

While a tester has a position within the team, there is a risk of loss of independence and objective evaluation.

Fully independent, separated test teams are usually assigned on-demand during the final days of each sprint. This preserves independence, but time pressure, lack of experience with the product, and relationship issued with the stakeholders may lead to problems.

Independent, separate test team assigned on a long-term basis; are usually more independent while gaining good understanding of the product and good relationships with other team members.

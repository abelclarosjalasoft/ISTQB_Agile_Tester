Agile lifecycles are very short iterations, and each iteration delivers a product with added value to the previous. At the beginning of the project there is a [[Release Planning]] period, then there are sequence of iterations. at the begging of each iteration there is an [[Iteration Planning]] period. When the iteration scope is established, the selected user stories are developed, integrated with the system, and tested. Testing activities are executed throughout the iteration, not as a final activity.

- Testers, developers, and stakeholders all have a role in testing. [[Quality is responsibility of the whole team]]
- Developers perform unit tests.
- Testers test features.
- Stakeholders test the stories and the product.

Good practices:
- No feature is considered done until it has been integrated ad tested with the system. 
- Defects remaining from previous iterations should be addressed at the beginning of the current iteration.
- At the end of a sequence of iterations there can be extra activities to get the software ready for delivery
When risk-based testing is used, risk analysis can be addressed during a [[Release Planning]]. 
Specific quality risk from each iteration are identified and assessed in [[Iteration Planning]].
Those previous analysis will influence the estimation of test effort. [[Assesing Quality Risks and Estimating Test Effort|Section 3.2]]

Pairing can be used, tester-tester, or developer-tester.
Testers can serve as testing a quality coaches in the team to promote a sense of collective ownership of quality of the product.

Automated testing occurs at all levels in an Agile team, testers may invest resources and time to creating, executing, monitoring, and maintain automated tests and results. Manual testing will focus on experience-based and defect-based techniques.

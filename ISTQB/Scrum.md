Scrum is an Agile management framework
# Instruments and Practices
- ***Sprint***: Iteration of fixed length. #sprint 
- ***Product Increment***: Result of a Sprint it may be a releasable/shippable product
- ***Product Backlog***: The PO (Product Owner) manages a prioritized list of planned product items. ^d7097c
- ***Sprint Backlog***: AT the start of each sprint the Team selects a set of high priority items from the product backlog.
- ***Definition of Done***: To ensure a releasable product at the end of the sprint, the team defines the criteria for the sprint completion.
- ***Timeboxing***: Time frame in which the team expects to finish its tasks. It also applies to meeting schedules. ^a9570a
- ***Transparency***: The team reports and updates its status in a daily basis in a meeting called daily scrum. 
# SCRUM Roles
- ***Scrum Master***: Not a lead but the team's coach. Ensures Scrum practices and rules are implemented, also resolves violations, resource issues, and any other impediment that could prevent Scrum execution.
- ***Product Owner***: Represents the customer. Generates, maintains, and prioritizes the product backlog. Not the team lead.
- ***Development Team***: Develops and tests the product. No team lead, the whole team makes decisions, it is also cross functional. [[Role of a Tester in an Agile Team]] [[Role of a Tester]]
Scrum does not dictates specific software development techniques, nor provide guidance on how testing has to be done in a Project.

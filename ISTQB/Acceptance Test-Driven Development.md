Acceptance TDD, defines the acceptance criteria at the creation of user stories [[Collaborative User Story Creation]].

It is a collaborative approach that defines how the software component has to behave, and what developers, testers, and business representatives need to do in order to make the component works as expected. The process is explained in [[Applying Acceptance Test-Driven Development]].

Acceptance TDD produces tests that will be included in regression testing/suites.
To reach System or Acceptance level test execution, specific tools will support creation and execution of the tests (Continuous Integration). Those tools can connect to data an service layers of the application.

Tester skills are mentioned in [[ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf|Foundation Level Syllabus]]
In addition the tester should be competent in: Test Automation, test-driven development, acceptance test-driven development, white-box, black-box, and experienced-based testing.

Tester in Agile teams should:
- Be positive and solution-oriented with team members and stakeholders 
- Display critical, quality-oriented, skeptical thinking about the product
- Actively acquire information from stakeholders (rather than relying entirely on written specifications)
- Accurately evaluate and report test results, test progress, and product quality
- Work effectively to define testable user stories, especially acceptance criteria, with customer representatives and stakeholders
- Collaborate within the team, working in pairs with programmers and other team members 
- Respond to change quickly, including changing, adding, or improving test cases
- Plan and organize their own work

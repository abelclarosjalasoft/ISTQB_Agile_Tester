Test planning should start during the release planning session and is update during each sprint.
Test planning for the release and each sprint should address the issues discussed in [[Release and Iteration Planning]]

Sprint planning results in a set of tasks to put on the task board. In addition, any testing issues should be tracked to keep a steady flow of testing.
